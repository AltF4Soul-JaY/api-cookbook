Fact Dynamics is a cross‑platform Flutter application that leverages Perplexity's Sonar API to provide real‑time fact‑checking for spoken and visual content—perfect for debates, presentations, or on‑the‑fly image verification. Built as a Perplexity Hackathon submission in the Information Tools & Deep Research & Education categories.

## Features

- **Real‑time Speech Analysis** - Transcribes live audio (via `speech_to_text`) and fact‑checks each snippet instantly
- **Image Fact Verification** - Extracts text from images and verifies claims on‑device
- **Claim Rating System** - Classifies claims as **TRUE**, **FALSE**, **MISLEADING**, or **UNVERIFIABLE**
- **Source Citations** - Surfaces authoritative URLs backing each verdict
- **User Authentication** - Firebase Auth (Google & Email) with secure Firestore persistence
- **Debate Mode** - Continuous speech recognition with streaming feedback
- **Cross‑platform** - iOS, Android, Web (macOS testing; Windows coming soon)

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your development machine
- Firebase account for authentication and data persistence
- Perplexity Sonar API key
- Device with microphone access for speech recognition
- Camera access for image capture (optional)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishnu32510/fact_pulse.git
   cd fact_pulse
   ```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase for your platform**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication (Google, Email) and Firestore Database
   - Install and configure FlutterFire CLI:
     ```bash
     dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
     flutterfire configure
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project and platforms (iOS/Android/Web)

4. **Set up API key**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root (use `.env.template` as reference)
   - Add your Perplexity Sonar API key:
     ```
     PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

5. **Configure platform permissions**
   - For Android: Microphone and camera permissions are configured in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
   - For iOS: Permissions are configured in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

1. **Authentication**: Sign in with Google or email through Firebase Auth
2. **Speech Mode**: Tap the microphone to start real-time speech transcription and fact-checking
3. **Image Mode**: Upload an image or provide a URL to extract and verify text claims
4. **Debate Mode**: Enable continuous speech recognition for live debate fact-checking
5. **View Results**: Check claim ratings, explanations, and source citations

## Code Explanation

### Perplexity Sonar API Integration

The app integrates with Perplexity's Sonar API in two main ways:

1. **Debate Fact‑Checking**  
   - Stream 5‑second audio chunks → transcribe → send `textSnippet` to Sonar  
   - Parse JSON response for `{ claim, rating, explanation, sources }`

2. **Image Analysis**  
   - Upload or URL‑point to image → Sonar extracts on‑image text → verify each claim

```dart
final client = PerplexityClient(apiKey: env.SONAR_API_KEY);
final response = await client.analyzeClaim(textSnippet);
print('Rating: ${response.rating}, Confidence: ${response.confidence}');
```

The app processes audio in real-time, transcribes it using Flutter's speech-to-text package, and sends each snippet to the Sonar API for immediate fact verification with source citations.

### Custom SDKs Used

This project uses custom-built Perplexity API SDKs developed specifically for this hackathon:
- **perplexity_dart** - Core Dart SDK ([pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/perplexity_dart), [docs](perplexity-flutter))
- **perplexity_flutter** - Flutter widgets and utilities ([pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/perplexity_flutter), [docs](perplexity-flutter))

## Limitations

- Speech recognition accuracy depends on audio quality and background noise
- Fact-checking is limited to claims that can be verified through available online sources
- Image text extraction quality varies based on image resolution and text clarity
- Real-time processing may experience latency depending on network connectivity
- Cross-platform compatibility is still being tested for macOS and Windows
- API rate limits may affect continuous usage in high-volume scenarios
- Android microphone access permissions need to be added for long duration listening
