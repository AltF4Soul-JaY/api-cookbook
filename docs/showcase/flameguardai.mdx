## 🔥 Inspiration

The devastating LA wildfires were more than a tragic event — they were a turning point. While watching homes burn to the ground, I saw a story about one house that miraculously survived. That story stuck with me.

What protected that home? It wasn’t luck. It was planning — fire-resistant materials, defensible space, and design choices made long before disaster struck. This realization — combined with the rising difficulty of securing home insurance — inspired us to build **FlameGuard AI™**.

We wanted to create a tool that empowers **homeowners** to take fire risk prevention into their own hands — not just react after it’s too late.

## 🧠 What it does

**FlameGuard AI™** helps homeowners, buyers, and property professionals detect and act on **external fire vulnerabilities** like wildfires or neighboring structure fires. It’s more than a scan — it’s a personalized research assistant for your home.

## ⚙️ How we built it

FlameGuard AI™ is powered by a modern GenAI stack and built to scale.

- **Frontend**: Lightweight HTML dashboard with user account control, photo upload, and report access
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) with RESTful APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (local) with **Azure SQL-ready** schema
- **Containerization**: Dockerized for flexible local or cloud deployment
- **Cloud-ready**: Built for **Azure App Service** with dedicated database support

### 🔍 Deep Research with Perplexity Sonar API

The real innovation is how we use the **Perplexity Sonar API**:

1. After analyzing the uploaded image, we identify specific vulnerabilities (e.g., flammable roof, dry brush nearby).
2. For each risk, we generate a **custom research plan** — covering severity, mitigation strategies, and localized insights.
3. We run **iterative agentic-style calls** to Perplexity Sonar — treating it like a research assistant gathering the best available information.
4. The research is **aggregated, organized, and formatted** into an actionable HTML report — complete with citations, links, and visual guidance.

This kind of **structured, trustworthy, AI-powered research would not be possible without Perplexity**.


## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

- 🔁 Designing **multi-step research prompts** for Perplexity Sonar that maintain context across multiple fire vulnerabilities
- 🏠 Building **robust image analysis prompts** that generalize across diverse home types, lighting, and angles
- ⏳ Coordinating **asynchronous flows** between user input, vision analysis, deep research, and report generation
- ❌ One major challenge: we attempted to **automatically retrieve contractor email addresses** via Perplexity API to pre-fill outreach requests — with user consent, we wanted to connect homeowners directly to local professionals and even **submit quote requests** on their behalf.
    - While the idea worked conceptually, the email results from Perplexity were not reliably accurate or complete.
    - For now, we've **disabled this feature** in the UI, but it's a high-priority enhancement for our roadmap.
    - Future plan: we'll integrate a **dedicated MCP server for contractors**, allowing us to directly submit quote requests from homeowners in a structured, secure workflow.
- ⚖️ Balancing speed and depth: AI-generated insights must feel fast, but research quality takes time — designing a UX that handles that tension gracefully was not easy.


## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Successfully used **OpenAI Vision + Perplexity Sonar API** together in a meaningful, real-world workflow
- Built a functioning **MCP server** that integrates seamlessly with Claude for desktop users
- Created a product that is **genuinely useful for homeowners today** — not just a demo
- Kept the experience simple, affordable, and scalable from the ground up
- Made structured deep research feel accessible and trustworthy


## 📚 What we learned

- The **Perplexity Sonar API** is incredibly powerful when used agentically — not just for answers, but for reasoning.
- Combining **multimodal AI (image + research)** opens up powerful decision-support tools.
- Users want **actionable insights**, not just data — pairing research with guidance makes all the difference.
- Trust and clarity are key: our design had to communicate complex information simply and helpfully.


## 💳 Admin Credit System

To help manage resource usage and scale responsibly, we built a **credit-based system** for users. This allows us to give out free trial credits, support premium usage tiers, and track consumption transparently.

### What the Credit System Does:
- 🧾 **Tracks credits** per user (free and purchased)
- ➕ Admins can **grant credits**
- ➖ Admins can **revoke credits** safely (no negative balances)
- 🔄 **Usage is logged** with full transaction history
- 👁️ Credits update in real-time within the admin panel

### Admin Panel Features:
- View current user balances
- Grant or subtract credits via secure modals
- Automatically updates the user interface after each action
- View recent credit transaction history

### Credit Transaction Types:
- `admin_grant`: credits added by admin
- `usage`: credits used by the user for assessments
- `admin_revoke`: manual deduction by admins
- `initial_free`: signup bonus for new users

### Backend Highlights:
- 🔐 Safe SQL logic with balance checks
- 📦 Modular logic in `credit_utils.py`
- 🧠 Clean REST APIs for credit updates
- 📝 Full logging of every transaction

We designed this credit system to be **simple for admins**, **transparent for users**, and **ready for future billing integration**.
