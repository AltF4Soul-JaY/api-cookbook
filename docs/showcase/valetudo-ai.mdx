# Valetudo AI
  
**Valetudo AI** is a Perplexity Sonar-powered assistant that delivers fast, reliable, and well-cited answers to medical questions. Designed for parents, patients, and students — it cuts through misinformation with smart filters, visual input, and prompt-based queries.  
  
## Features  
  
- **Answers with Citations:** Provides numbered scientific citations from a curated list of **10** trusted medical **sources**.  
- **Advanced Filtering:** Allows users to filter results **by date and country** to get the most relevant information.  
- **Image Upload:** Supports visual context for queries (e.g., **photos** of medications or conditions).  
- **Prompt Templates:** Includes **7 categories** of pre-built prompts for common medical questions:  
  - Symptom-based advice  
  - Drug interaction checks  
  - Safety timing  
  - Safer treatments  
  - Compare effectiveness  
  - Recommended exercises  
  - Latest research  
- **Clean & Simple UI:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a **user-friendly** experience.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
Before installing and running Valetudo AI locally, ensure you have the following installed:  
  
- **Node.js** (tested with v22.15.0) and **npm** – for running the frontend (React + Vite)  
- **Python** (tested with v3.13.4) and **pip** – for the Flask backend  
- **Git** – to clone the repository  
- A valid **Perplexity API key** – required to query the Sonar API ([how to generate one](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/quickstart))  
- (Optional) **Virtual environment support** (e.g., `venv`) – for isolating Python dependencies  
- (Optional) A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome) – to access the app
  
## Installation  
  
### 1. Clone the repo  
  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/vero-code/valetudo-ai.git
cd valetudo-ai
```  
  
### 2. Set environment variables  
  
Create a `.env` file inside the `/backend` folder with the following content:  
  
`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`  
  
> Refer to `/backend/.env.example` for guidance. 
> Never commit your `.env` file to version control.  
  
### 3. Start the frontend  
  
```bash  
npm install
npm run dev
```  
  
### 4. Start the backend  
  
```bash  
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment  
# On Windows:  
venv\Scripts\activate  
  
# On macOS/Linux:  
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```  
  
The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)  
  
## Usage  
  
Here are some ways to use Valetudo AI effectively:  
  
### 1. Ask a health question  
  
- Type a question like:  
  _"What to do if a 5-year-old has a fever?"_  
- Click **"Ask AI"**  
- Expand the full answer  
- Hover over citation numbers to preview and copy links  
  
### 2. Use filters  
  
- Click **"Show advanced options"**  
- Set a custom **date range**  
- Choose a **country** to localize results  
  
### 3. Upload an image  
  
- Drag and drop or manually upload a photo (e.g., medication or condition)  
- Ask: _"What is this medication?"_  
- The AI will use image context in its response  
  
### 4. Try prompt templates  
  
- Click **"Try Prompts"**  
- Select one of **7 categories**  
- Fill in the fields and generate a ready-to-send query  
- Use the **follow-up input** to refine or expand the conversation  
  
## Code Explanation  
  
### Perplexity API Integration  
  
Valetudo AI leverages the Sonar API to its full potential. The core Q&A functionality is powered by [Perplexity Sonar Pro API](https://docs.perplexity.ai).  
  
| Feature               | API Field                          | Usage                                                                  |  
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Search Context Size   | `search_context_size: medium`      | Balances depth and speed of the response for concise medical answers.  |  
| Domain Filtering      | `search_domain_filter`             | Limits answers to a curated list of trusted medical domains.           |  
| Image Upload          | `image_url`                        | Enables visual-based questions like identifying medications or rashes. |  
| Date Filtering        | `search_after/before_date_filter`  | Allows users to narrow results by recency — useful for evolving topics.|  
| User Location Filter  | `user_location`                    | Prioritizes sources or context relevant to the user's country.         |  
  
> These parameters enable precise control over search quality, scope, and context — especially useful in the medical domain.
