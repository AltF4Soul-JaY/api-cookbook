# PerplexiGrid

**PerplexiGrid** turns natural language into rich, interactive dashboards. Connect your data and mix it with live web data, ask a question, and let the Sonar API do the rest! Complete with drag-and-drop layout, AI widget generation, and ECharts-powered visualizations.

## Features

* Fully customizable dashboards generated from plain English prompts with 25+ supported widget types (charts, KPIs, tables, heatmaps, etc.)
* Smart layout with a customizable drag-and-drop grid, shareable as PDF/image exports and shareable links  
* Refine or add widgets using conversational updates  
* Support for live data from the web + your own datasources

## Prerequisites

* Node.js 18 or newer  
* Supabase project + API keys  
* Perplexity Sonar API key  
* Supabase CLI for deploying Edge Functions  

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PetarRan/perplexigrid.git
cd perplexigrid 
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```
cd client
npm install
```

Create your `.env` file inside `client/`:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co  
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key  
VITE_PPLX_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key  
```

Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Supabase Edge Function Setup

Install the Supabase CLI:  
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli

Link to your project:

```
supabase link --project-ref your-project-id
```

Create the Edge Function:

```
supabase functions new call-perplexity
```

Paste your implementation into:  
`functions/call-perplexity/index.ts`

Set the environment variable (via Supabase Dashboard):

`PPLX_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key  `

Deploy the function:

```
supabase functions deploy call-perplexity
```

Your frontend calls it at: `/call-perplexity`

## Usage

1. Open the app and start a new dashboard  
2. Prompt it like: _“Show me market trends in AI startups in 2024”_  (Sonar generates chart configs, which are parsed and rendered as live widgets)

3. Rearrange and style the widgets with the grid interface

5. Add your own datasources to blend your data with live web data

6. Refine them via text prompts or export the dashboard as needed  
7. Collaborate and share easily

## Code Explanation

The user sends messages that are turned into prompts to a Supabase Edge Function that wraps the Perplexity Sonar API.  
Depending on the mode (`f1`, `l1`, `r1`, or `r2`), the function generates full structured outputs for dashboards, lightweight visualizations, or targeted updates.  
The generated layout is parsed into structured widget definitions and passed through our widget creation engine.

## Prompt Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| `f1` | First-time full dashboard generation | User starts with an empty canvas and enters an initial prompt | Produces a complete dashboard layout with multiple widgets |
| `l1` | Lightweight dashboard generation | Used for quick insights or previews with minimal tokens | Faster and cheaper, but returns fewer widgets with less instruction depth |
| `r1` | Full dashboard regeneration | User wants to replace all existing widgets with a new prompt | Rebuilds the entire dashboard while keeping layout intact |
| `r2` | Targeted widget update | User wants to change a specific widget (e.g. “make this a pie chart”) | Only the selected widget is modified based on the new instruction |
