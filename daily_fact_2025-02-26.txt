An interesting and lesser-known fact about ocean life is that **deep-sea hydrothermal vents** support ecosystems that don't rely on sunlight. Instead, these ecosystems use chemosynthesis to convert chemicals from the Earth's crust into energy, allowing unique creatures like tube worms and giant clams to thrive in extreme conditions[1][3]. This unique adaptation allows life to flourish in places where sunlight cannot reach.
